            ROCAMOCHA grew up listening to a wide variety of music styles growing up.
            Having been born in Sacramento, CA to teenage parents in 1996 and surrounded by a large music-loving extended family,
            his musical experience in the formative years of his life was multigenerational and diverse. Between the ages of 4 and 6,
            ROCAMOCHA participated as a bit of an unruly piano student at the Masaki School of Music in Honolulu. The lessons had
            ended long before his family would move back to California and it would be years before formal education in music performance
            was revisited. When faced with a choice between study hall and band class before entering the sixth grade at
            Cooley Middle School in Roseville, CA - ROCAMOCHA chose band class, with the Trumpet as his instrument of choice.

            Jazz and composition became the centerpieces of ROCAMOCHA's musical studies throughout this time. ROCAMOCHA's parents applied
            for an intra-district transfer to Rio Americano High School, about a 40 minute drive from where they lived.
            ROCAMOCHA was fortunate to have the opportunity to tour with musical groups in Japan and Spain, in addition to performing at
            some of the most widely recognized jazz festivals in the United States both as a trumpeter and a bassist.

            Despite suffering a collapsed lung in his senior year of high school, ROCAMOCHA was able to make his audition for the
            Berklee College of Music and was nominated for one of 5 presidential scholarship awards from the school. It was the
            only institution that he had applied to. ROCAMOCHA received a dual degree in Contemporary Writing and Production &
            Professional Music with a Concentration in Video Game Scoring after 6 years of study.

            ROCAMOCHA now focuses on making electronic music that stays true to his enthusiasm for all things cute üçìü•ù
